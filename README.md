In this project, I simulate the role of a Business Intelligence Analyst for AdventureWorks Cycles, a fictional manufacturing company. The task is to transform raw datasets into interactive reports and dashboards that monitor KPIs, compare performance across regions, analyze product-level trends, and highlight high-value customers.

# 1. AdventureWorks Analytics: Business Performance Dashboard
A dynamic, interactive data visualization tool built to explore manufacturing data focusing on sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends. It helps track KPIs, analyze revenue growth, and identify high-value customers. 

# 2. Purpose
The purpose of this dashboard is to provide business performance insights for AdventureWorks Cycles, a fictional manufacturing company.
It helps stakeholders to:
Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as revenue, total orders, return rate, and profit.
Analyze sales trends over time (weekly/monthly revenue).
Compare performance by product categories and top products.
Track customer insights (unique customers, revenue per customer, top 100 customers).
Identify high-value customers and potential areas for growth.
Support decision-making by highlighting return patterns and profitability.

# 3. Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
- Power BI Desktop                :for data modeling, DAX calculations, and building interactive dashboards.
- AdventureWorks Dataset          :primary data source.
- Power Query                     :for data cleaning, transformation, and shaping.

# 4. Data Source
The dataset used in this project is based on the AdventureWorks Cycles sample database.
For this dashboard, the data was provided as part of a Udemy Power BI course in pre-processed formats, CSV files.
